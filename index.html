            I am a Programmer at <a target="_blank"
            href="http://www.icad.puc-rio.br">
            ICAD/VisionLab</a>,
            Prof. Bruno Feijó's Computer Vision, CG and Games lab at PUC-Rio <b>since June 2013</b>.
            I'm currently one of the lead programmers in a 3D game written in 
            <span class="skill">C#</span> using <span class="skill">Unity 3D</span>. One of its main
            research goals is to improve narrative and storytelling process on videogames.
            <br>
            I was also the sole programmer responsible for writing two projects for 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://redeglobo.globo.com/">Rede Globo</a>, the largest 
            brazilian TV network.
            <br>
            The first one was MarkerFinder, which aimed to make the process of mapping fiducial 
            markers on a studio's ceiling automatic. This map of markers is used to calculate a 
            camera's position in the studio, making it possible to superimpose graphical effects 
            with precision. It's coded in <span class="skill">C++</span> using
            <a target="_blank" href="http://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a>.
            <br>
            The second deals with loading video frames to GPU, for fast processing. 
            It was written in <span class="skill">C</span>.

            <h4>MarkerFinder</h4>
            Coded in <span class="skill">C++</span>, it was commissioned by 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://redeglobo.globo.com/">Rede Globo</a> from 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.icad.puc-rio.br/">
            ICAD/VisionLab</a>. This project's goal was to make the mapping of fiducial markers 
            on a studio's ceiling automatic. This mapping process is a crucial preparation step 
            for the use of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lightcrafttech.com/">LightCraft</a>
            Technology. LightCraft uses an extra wide-angle lens equipped to a camera and pointed 
            to the ceiling, which is covered in fiducial markers. This lens captures the location 
            of these markers and, with a previously known map, calculates the camera's location in 
            the studio. The superimposition of virtual elements on the footage is considerably easier 
            when this location is known. Before <b>MarkerFinder</b>, this mapping was done manually
            and took about 4 hours, now it takes 20 to 40 minutes. Since this was made for a 
            brazilian company, it is documented in Portuguese.

            <h4>Travelling Salesman Problem, Heuristics Comparison</h4>
            Coded in <span class="skill">Python</span>, this was made to compare the performance
            of different
            Heuristics to determine the minimal Hamiltonian cycle in a complete graph. This is a
            famous NP-Complete problem, the Travelling Salesman Problem.
            <br>It was a requirement of the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course and was
            made by me, Carla Galdino and Hugo Musso Gualandi.

            of the common cards, as well as the hand itself. Contrary to more
            common "calculators", this one computes the odds of a hand
            without knowing the opponents'.

            Inspired by the raging bull that was driving the real estate prices in
            Rio de Janeiro to the sky in 2011-13, this <span class="skill">Python</span> script
            calculates the optimal
            down payment on a house. The user inputs the value of the house; how much money
            is set aside; the expected interest on such money; monthly disposable income;
            the annual interest to be paid to the bank and the number of payments.
            The script then gives the down payment value that optimizes either total
            amount of money after all is paid or the average monthly financial impact.

            <h4>Hunter Prey</h4>
            Made using <span class="skill">Unity</span> and scripts in
            <span class="skill">C#</span>, it is a game made as a
            requirement for the Artificial Intelligence for 3D Games course. It is a competitive
            game between hunters - the player and the non playable characters (NPC's). The
            hunters score taking preys to the goals. The speed that a hunter moves is a function
            of its strength and the prey's weight. The decision making process of an NPC's take in
            consideration its strength, the intention of those stronger than him, the surrounding
            preys' distances and weights. It implements the well known A* pathfinding algorithm
            to find the nearest safe goal and avoid obstacles and enemies. Made by me and Felipe Baldino.
