I've been a Computer Vision Engineer at [EnVsion](https://www.envsion.io/){:target="_blank"} <b>since June 2020</b>

As a member of the founding team, apart from the following technical aspects of my role, I also get to witness and participate on company structuring and strategic activities.

I write software to extract information from video with Computer Vision and Deep Learning. Code is usually in <span class="skill">Python</span>, with <span class="skill">OpenCV</span>, <span class="skill">TensorFlow</span>, and <span class="skill">Jupyter Notebooks</span>. Both <span class="skill">OpenCV</span> and <span class="skill">TensorFlow</span> run on GPU, using <span class="skill">CUDA</span>'s <span class="skill">cuDNN</span> drivers.

Some examples of what I've done so far include:
* Writing classes that make object detection easier, abstracting the underlying models, such as <span class="skill">YOLO</span>, <span class="skill">Mask RCNN</span>, and <span class="skill">SSD</span>, for example
* Using and tweaking the implementation of <span class="skill">Deep SORT</span> for object tracking
* Creating a simple and modular pipeline structure for plugging and unplugging deep learning functionalities

The team members all work remotely. Communication and productivity tools include <span class="skill">GIT</span>, <span class="skill">Trello</span> and <span class="skill">Slack</span>.
