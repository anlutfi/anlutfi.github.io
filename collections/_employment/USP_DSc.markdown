I am a DSc candidate at the [Computational Mathematics and Sciences Institute](https://www.icmc.usp.br/){:target="_blank"} since<b> February 2022</b>, with <b>expected</b> graduation in <b>March 2026</b>.

Advised by [João Batista Neto](https://sites.icmc.usp.br/jbatista/){:target="_blank"}, I research on how to improve Deep Leanring models that employ [Visual Attention](https://shairozsohail.medium.com/a-survey-of-visual-attention-mechanisms-in-deep-learning-1043eb25f343){:target="_blank"} mechanisms by using eye-tracking devices during data labeling.
