I was a Programmer and Prototyper at [OHMS](https://www.facebook.com/ourhomemakerspace/){:target="_blank"} <b>from April 2016 until June 2017</b> when it closed. It was a MakerSpace in Rio de Janeiro that took on both comissioned and internal research projects.

I investigated ways to improve on the [FabScan](https://hci.rwth-aachen.de/fabscan){:target="_blank"} 3D Scanner so it could run with multiple cameras, multiple laserbeams and auto-calibration with fiducial markers, giving the user the possibility to adjust the layout according to the shape of the scanned object. The code was in <span class="skill">Python</span>.

I was also the developer and main creator of the [Invisible Wall]({{ site.baseurl }}/InvisibleWall), an interactive art instalation for a 2016 Arts and Technology Festival by [Incubadora de Artistas](http://www.incubadoradeartistas.com.br/), coded in <span class="skill">C</span>/<span class="skill">C++</span>.

Both these projects use <span class="skill">OpenCV</span>'s resources.
