<b>From August 2010 to July 2012</b> - As a Database Analyst for [ICA](http://www.ica.ele.puc-rio.br){:target = "_blank"} (<span class="skill">SQL</span>), I was part of the team developing project Munic√≠pios Inteligentes <i>(Intelligent Cities)</i>, which aimed to improve the management of public resources throughout the state of Rio de Janeiro's cities with the use of Artificial Intelligence.

I was responsible for studying and understanding each of the project's pilot cities' revenue databases and migrate their data to the database designed by the Business Intelligence team.
