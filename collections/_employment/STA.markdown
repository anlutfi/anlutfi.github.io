<b>From July 2006 to January 2009</b> - First as an <b>Intern</b> then as a <b>Trainee</b>, I had my first experience managing proofs of concept, projects and client relations. I coded, on <span class="skill">Delphi/Pascal</span>, database and statistical analysis software on a proprietary high speed platform.

As a Trainee I dealt mainly with a product for market segmentation and selection. The customers were usually large companies with big client databases. StoneAge's product could segment these kinds of databases very quickly, showing how many people were in each segment. The company could then decide to launch a marketing campaign for a very specific target audience. My role in this was understanding the customers' needs and implementing the processes so they could use this product.
