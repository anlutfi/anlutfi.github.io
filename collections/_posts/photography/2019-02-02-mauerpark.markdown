This is one of the favorite pictures I took. A crowd cheering at open-air karaoke singers at Mauer Park on a summer sunday afternoon. It's a very lucky angle, there are no distortions and everyone seems to be looking straight at the lens.<!--more-->

There are a lot of sub-pictures within this one. My favorites being this bald guy, the two women in love with the prognostic of beer, and the three ecstatic girls evidently loving the performance. I honestly don't remember what was playing.

There were a lot of other performances also going on in smaller venues at the park on that day. Some crowds compensated for their numbers with their enthusiasm. I used to have a shirt just like that one.
