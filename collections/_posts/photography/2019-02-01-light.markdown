Light is, obviously, the only actual thing that makes a picture. Ironically, it is almost never the subject of one. It takes a background role in showing us the beauty of a model, the warmth of a sunset, the blue of the ocean, and many other cheesy clich√©s. These ones are different: they make you think of Light itself.

The cover picture is a sunset -or the indication thereof- at the top of the Taipei 101 Tower in Taipei, Taiwan; one of my favorite cities.

This is a night at Hoi-An, a very special Vietnamese town. I met a lot of other people who traveled through Vietnam, and we all recommend it.

The last one is the morning light squeezing through the gaps in the curtains of a hotel room in Malaysia. I never discovered what outside objects were responsible for the colors, but they are fascinating. They are pretty close to being Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow: the three primary colors of the CMYK model. All others can be obtained by a mixture of these. Printers, for example, have only these three inks and black.

Looking closely, it's possible to notice an arrow sticker on the ceiling, at the bottom part of the picture and a little to the right of the middle. It points towards Mecca, the sacred city of Islam, indicating where muslims should face during prayer.
