Trying to make the best of one big -if not the biggest- clich√©, I chose three of my favorite sunsets.

The cover is the beginning of an early autumn evening in Dubrovnik, Croatia. I got to the top of Srd Hill by the famous cable car. After spending a lot of time enjoying the view, I decided to hike down. <!--more--> Light was almost gone in the trail and, having no jacket and wearing flip-flops, I had to pick up the pace. This rainbow-colored composition struck me as I was nearly in the end of the way.

This one is in Koh Phangan, an island off the east coast of Thailand, a very dear place to me. I was there during "Winter", when every day's weather seemed meticulously programmed. It rains from 16:00 to 17:00, then the skies clear and there is a pink sunset. These trees were by the side of a road on which I walked every day to go home.

This is also in Thailand, near the town of Pai. Pai Canyon is a classic sunset watching spot.
