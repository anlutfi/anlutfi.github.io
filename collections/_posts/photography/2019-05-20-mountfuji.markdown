Mount Fuji is visible for only 80 days a year. In my second trip to Japan -and second attempt to see it- I got the better end of this 22% chance bet.<!--more--> We arrived at Yamanashi around 6pm on a cloudy day and had just the one night reserved with the hotel. The clouds completely cleared out during the night, when I took the cover photo.

The next one was took at dawn. The last two, at 10am, right before we left the town. Cherry blossoms are usually gone by early May, but Yamanashi is a bit higher and colder, so they were still there.
