Leaving Ulaanbaatar in late November is a relief in itself. -35°C and a constant smell of smoke make up for an average day in the Mongolian capital. Spending six days in the Gobi desert is great in itself. The pleasant -16°C and crisp air were just an added bonus.

Most tourists flee mongolia in the middle of october. For three days, it seemed that we would not be able to find any other late suckers to fill the van and make the tour. Everything worked out, though, and we got to meet Björn and George, a Finnish and a British.<!--more-->

It takes two days to get to Gobi per se, so we slept at its outskirts on the first night, on a nomadic family's winter house. Due to the weather, they mostly shepperd their livestock during the season. Although pretty simple, most of the nomadic families abandoned the horse for a more practical mounting.

The livestock is usually set to roam freely during the day and is gathered back at night. Being the least populated country on the planet, mixing herds is not an usual problem. Even so, animals have their horns painted for owner identification. This particular family uses blue and yellow.

From the next day onward, it's a drastic change of scenery. The snow completely disappears and the landscape aquires more of a stereotypical desert look. The accomodations also change: nomads in the Gobi desert live in tents called Gers. They are kept warm during the night by a hearth that's fed by either wood or manure. Since Gobi's bushes tend to burn quite quickly, the families that used manure were our favorites. The night sky was absolutely amazing, as it tends to be when the air is dry.
