<p class="text">
I am a generalist programmer with broad interests and a special passion for art and entertainment. I've been more recently involved in hardware prototyping, makerspaces and CG/CV. My current goal is to work on multidisciplinary tech research, be it in Academia or private sector.
<br>
I have experience in multiple areas, ranging from state budget to Computer Vision art installations. I love the enormous variety of problems that can be solved with Computer Science and relish new challenges and learning things from scratch.
