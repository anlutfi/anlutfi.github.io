Coded in <span class="skill">Python</span>, this was made to compare the performance of different Heuristics to determine the minimal Hamiltonian cycle in a complete graph. This is the famous Travelling Salesman Problem, an NP-Complete problem.
It was a requirement of the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course and was made by me, Carla Galdino and Hugo Musso Gualandi.
