Coded in <span class="skill">C</span>, it is a Heuristic that I conceived to find an upper bound for an instance of the Travelling Salesman Problem. Despite yielding good results, the computational times did not yet improve on [the current state-of-the-art](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin%E2%80%93Kernighan_heuristic){:target="_blank}.

This is an ongoing project of mine, so I won't post links for now.
