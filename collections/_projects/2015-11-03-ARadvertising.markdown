My senior thesis, in Portuguese, originally titled <i>"Análise Crítica: A Relação entre Realidade Aumentada e Publicidade"</i>. It presents an analysis of the Augmented Reality applications in Advertising in 2010, its advantages, conceptual limitations and opportunities for improvement using advertising theorists as base for the evaluation. It takes the relationship between the two fields as an example of communication between Academic Research and Market.
