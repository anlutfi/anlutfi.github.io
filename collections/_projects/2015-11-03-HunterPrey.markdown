Made using <span class="skill">Unity 3D</span> and scripts in <span class="skill">C#</span>, this project is a game made as a requirement for the Artificial Intelligence for 3D Games course.  
It is a competitive game between hunters - the player and the non playable characters (NPC's). The hunters score taking preys to the goals. The speed that a hunter moves is a function of its strength and the prey's weight. The decision making process of an NPC's take in consideration its strength, the intention of those stronger than him, the surrounding preys' distances and weights. It implements the well known A* pathfinding algorithm to find the nearest safe goal and avoid obstacles and enemies.
