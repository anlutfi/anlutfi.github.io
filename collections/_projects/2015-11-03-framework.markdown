My MSc thesis, in Portuguese, originally titled <i>"Um Framework para Game Shows Interativos de TV com Realidade Aumentada e Segunda Tela"</i>. It proposes a framework for the development of interactive TV game shows using Augmented Reality in TV studios, which allows the participation of viewers using tablets and smartphones as the Second Screen. It also investigates new convergence paradigms between TV and video games, utilizing the concept of Play/Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi as the desirable state to achieve while playing. All the code in this project was written in <span class="skill">Python</span>.<br>
