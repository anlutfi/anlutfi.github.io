Coded in <span class="skill">R</span>, it uses random walks in images to segment them into regions. We implemented the [original Algorithm by Leo Grady](http://vision.cse.psu.edu/people/chenpingY/paper/grady2006random.pdf){:target="_blank"}, as well as an altered version that sets the maximum number of steps in a walk, limiting the computing time. It's a trade-off between accuracy and performance. <br>This was a requirement for a Stochastic Simulation course and was made by me and Ericsson Leal.
