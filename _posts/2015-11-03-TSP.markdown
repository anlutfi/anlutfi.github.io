Coded in <span class="skill">Python</span>, this was made to compare the performance of different Heuristics to determine the minimal Hamiltonian cycle in a complete graph. This is a famous NP-Complete problem, the Travelling Salesman Problem.  
It was a requirement of the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course and was made by me, Carla Galdino and Hugo Musso Gualandi.
