I am a Programmer and Prototyper at [OHMS](https://www.facebook.com/ourhomemakerspace/){:target="_blank"} <b>Since April 2016</b>. It is a MakerSpace in Rio de Janeiro that takes on both comissioned and internal research projects.

I am currently investigating ways to improve on the [FabScan](https://hci.rwth-aachen.de/fabscan){:target="_blank"} 3D Scanner so it can run with multiple cameras and multiple laserbeams and calibrates itself with a fiducial marker, giving the user the possibility to adjust the layout according to the scanned object. The code is in <span class="skill">Python</span>.

I am also involved in the development of an art instalation for a museum.

Both these projects use <span class="skill">OpenCV</span>'s resources.
