Originally titled <i>"Estudo exploratório inicial para geração automática de narrativas com Agentes BDI para jogos"</i>. We conducted a <span class="skill">Java</span> experiment to determine whether the result of individual interactions by autonomous agents, behaving like literary characters, would result in an interesting plot. It is suggested that a "narrator" could be used to detect the plot's tendency to lose its appeal and stimulate characters to behave in a more interesting manner. The document also presents an overview of the state-of-the-art in Interactive Storytelling.  
This work was done as part of a Multi-Agent Systems graduate course.
