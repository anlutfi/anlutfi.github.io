Hi and welcome! I am a generalist programmer with broad interests and a special passion for art and entertainment. I've been more recently involved in hardware prototyping, makerspaces and CG/CV. I am looking to be doing multidisciplinary research at a PhD level as soon as possible. Computer Science, more than a pleasure in itself, is an amazing tool to learn about and help in almost every field of knowledge.

Here you will find things I've coded, written, and my resume. I'm also into photography, so there's a blog too, mainly about it. All the pictures in the site are mine.
